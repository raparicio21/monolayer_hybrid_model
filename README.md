# monolayer_hybrid_model
Hybrid model of a cell epithelial monolayer, which combines an agent based model (ABM) with a Finite Element Method (FEM)

Two cases are included, 1_uninfected_monolayer and 2_infected_monolayer. Code based on a Matlab environment, but it also includes files to run the Finite Element Method (FEM) on the commercial software ABAQUS. Output files (folder called as results) can be loaded in ParaView.

The main file to run is topology.m
